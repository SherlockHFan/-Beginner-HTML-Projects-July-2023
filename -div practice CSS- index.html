<!-- CASCADING style sheet Intro-
      What is the cascading part of CSS? 
      The "cascading" part of CSS is a way to establish hierarchy in a website. i.e. a waterfall,
      the code looks at the top of the waterfall first, then the middle, until reaching the bottom.
        Example-
          index.html
          ------------
          <ol>
            <li>One</li>
            <li>Two</li>
            <li>Three</li>
          </ol>

          style.css
          -----------
          li{
            color: green;
          }

          In the above example, the style.css rules will change the color of ALL the list items to 
          green. If changed to a inline style for one:
            <li style="color: pink">Two</li>
            Cascading stylesheets follow these rules:
              1. Checks the external stylesheet and applies the style.
              2. Or checks the Internal Stylesheet and applies styles 
                 following a style tag.
              3. Finally checks the html for inline styles.
          The middle item, "Two", will change to pink while the rest will remain green, following
          the 3rd option.

<!-- CSS Position- Comes before all others-this is the rule that looks for whether a 
              rule is at a higher, or lower, position relative to other rules.
              li{
                color: pink;
                color: blue
              }
              ^--In the above example, the text turns pink first, then blue due to following the 
                 rule of position.
              Postion applies to everything, including curly braces{}. The further down the code in a external stylesheet 
              goes:(1.   , only this furthest rule/style will be applied.
                    2. 
                    3. )

<!-- CSS: Specificity- CSS Specificity- How specific a selector is when applying CSS rules to them
  - Example- 
      index.html
      --------------
      <li id="first-id" class="first-class" draggable> 
        ^-- This is the opening tag for the list item element.
      ---------------------  
      style.css
      --------------  
      li{color: blue;}  <-- This line selects all the list items and makes them blue. This line is the least speciic.
      .first-class{color: red;} <-- This line uses the class selector (.) to specify the color for 'first-class' elements will be red.
      li[draggable] {color: purple;} <-- This line represents the 'attribute' element being made draggable, and its color turning to purple. The attribute element in most cases overwrites the class selector.
      #first-id{color: orange;} <-- This line represents the 'id' selector, and changes the 'first-id' to orange. The pound sign ('#') is used for this.
      
        -- The id selector has higher importance then the class selector.

      -The elements in the style.css file target and make changes by each
       specific element. 
      - In certain code, there will only be one id name.
-->
<!-- CSS: Type- Three various types, External, Internal, and Inline
   - External CSS uses a link refrerence to connect the html file to the CSS file.
      -<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">

   - Internal is the use of an internal style element that you place CSS inbetween the opening and closing brackets.
      Internal CSS has second importance. This is because Internal CSS focuses on one webpage, unlike external can be aplied to
      multiple webpages/websites.
      - <style> BLANK </style>
   - Inline is when a specific style is applied through the style attributes(h1) opening tag for a html element. 
      Inline has the greatest importance because Inline CSS targets only one specific element.
      - <h1 style=" ">HEEEEEEELLOOOOOOOooooooo</h>

-->
<!-- CSS: Importance- A keyword that can be used in code, is represented by:
   - color: red;
     color: green !importance;
   - To use the 'importance' keyword, you must add a '!' before it. By using this keyword, no matter how 
      far down or up in code this is written, the code with the importance keyword will be listed above 
      all other code.
